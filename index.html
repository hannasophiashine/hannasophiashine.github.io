        Hello! My name is Hanna and I am the lab manager for the <a href="https://www.harvardlds.org/our-labs/snedeker-lab/" target="_blank">Snedeker Lab</a> (since June 2023). I graduated from the 
        <a href="https://www.umd.edu" target="_blank">University of Maryland, College Park</a> in May 2023 with a B.S. in 
        <a href="https://psyc.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Psychology</a> and a minor in 
        <a href="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/colleges-schools/arts-humanities/classical-languages-literature/classical-mythology-minor/#requirementstext" target="_blank">Classical Mythology</a>. 
        As an undergrad at UMD, I was a research assistant in the 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/ecilab/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Early Childhood Interaction Lab</a>, 
        the <a href="https://irlumd.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Interpersonal Relationships Lab</a>, and the 
        <a href="https://lmcl-umd.github.io/" target="_blank">Language and Music Cognition Lab</a>. I wrote my undergraduate thesis under the mentorship of 
        <a href="https://lmcl-umd.github.io/authors/bob/" target="_blank">Dr. Bob Slevc</a> on the influence of perceived accent prestige on lexical and syntactic alignment in “dialogue”

    <p>
        I am broadly interested in language and cognition and, more specifically, I would like to explore how people map meaning onto lingusitic form. I am interested in exploring this process in the following ways: 
<br>
<br>
    <p>        
<strong style="color: #DC267F;">(a)</strong> from a <strong>developmental perspective</strong>, what tools do children use to understand the relationship between abstract concepts and their lingusitic form? What do they have access to pre-lingusitically that facilliates this mapping process? What do they extract from language to facillitate this? 
    <p>         
<strong style="color: #DC267F;">(b)</strong> within the <strong>intersection of syntax and semantics</strong>, how do people transition from the internal conceptualization of something (e.g., viewing event in the world & wanting to describe it to someone) into a syntactic construction? What can we learn from cross-lingusitic work about this process? How does what we encode into language change depending on external factors?
    <p>        
<strong style="color: #DC267F;">(c)</strong> with a focus on <strong>events and event structure</strong>, how do we represent event participants in the absence of language? What properties of event representations exist pre-linguistically and what properties do we extract from language?
    <p>

<p>
    <strong style="color: #648FFF;">Currently, I am working on a number of projects through the Snedeker Lab. You can learn more about them below!</strong>
<p>
    <strong style="color: #FE6100;">(1)</strong> <strong>Do the thematic roles of agent and patient serve as a readily available dimension for categorizing event participants in the absence of explicit language?</strong> Working with Dr. Irene Canudas Grabolosa and Dr. Jesse Snedeker we are investigating whether individuals can access these roles and use them to explicitly catageorize event participants engaged in contact and cause-motion events. <i>Spoilers:</i> they do!
    <p>     
    Through an online computer-based task on the PcIbex platform (Zehr & Schwarz, 2018), participants will view short videos depicting contact actions (such as hitting or hugging). We will model their responses, guiding them to select either the agent or the patient. Following the modeling phase, participants will apply the learned selection rule to new contact and motion verbs in a test phase, assessing generalization. This work was done with English-speaking adults, English-speaking children, and homesigners based in Nicaragua. I presented a poster on this work at the <a href="https://hsp2025.github.io/" target="_blank">Human Sentence Processing</a> conference in March 2025! The abstract can be found <a href="https://hsp2025.github.io/abstracts/182.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <p>
    What did we find? With English-speaking adults we found that they performed almost perfectly at test, both for new contact (M=95%) and caused-motion events (M=95%). This demonstrates that they could infer these categories and extend them to new instances of the same event type and a new event type. We also found that children reliably learned and generalized both agent and patient rules, performing well above chance in both new contact (M=80%) and caused-motion events (M=72%).And what did we find with the homesigners? Homesigners were able to distinguish agents and patients in new contact events (M=64%) but performance with caused-motion events was not above chance with the current sample (M = 56%).
    <p>
These findings suggest that the concepts of agent and patient, or something very similar in scope, are available to people even when they have not had extensive exposure to a language that marks these distinctions syntactically. It is also important to note that our sample of homesigners was 7 individuals. This is a HUGE sample when it comes to work with homesigners (all the credit for this incredible recruitment goes to the Nicaragua team led by Dr. Annemarie Kocab and Dr. Marie Coppola!!!) but at the end of the day it is relatively small in comparison to what we had with adults (90) and children (20). Looking ahead, we want to explore whether the more variable performance in homesigners can be ameliorated through greater experience with the task (the experimenters noted that some of events we used in this study may have been too fast at times) and whether their performance is related to the marking of agent and patient in their own signed utterances.
    <p>
    We are also interested in exploring how event roles interact with linguistic structure and how we can use this to explore other thematic roles. Specifically, the goal of this study is to train individuals to categorize event participants using agent and patient non-linguistically and then test whether they can apply what they have learned to a linguistic task. Specifically, in this task we are asking individuals to map the concepts of agent and patient onto two syntactic constructions in English: active and passive sentences. We are currently collecting data for this project and I am incredibly excited to see what happens! We plan to use this paradigm to explore the thematic roles of stimulus and experiencer!
     <p>
<strong style="color: #FE6100;">(2)</strong> <strong>Do the traits that we see in autistic individuals (children and adults) reflect a global prediction impairment?</strong> Working with Dr. Tanya Levari, Briony Waite (doctoral student), and Dr. Jesse Snedeker we are assessing predictive abilities across a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic domains in a single group of children with autism. By working with one well-characterized sample, we aim to see whether there are shared underlying mechanisms at work across these domains, or, if observed, predictive impairments are domain-specific, affecting some areas but not others.
     <p>
       This study includes both behavioral (standardized tests including the CELF and part of the Kbit) and brain measures (EEG) and a parallel study is being conducted with adults to allow for an exploration of the developmental trajectory of predictive abilities in this population. Within the context of this project I am providing mentorship to Cathyln Boyle, a full-time undergraduate research assistant on placement from the university of Bath, as she explores how autism and language ability interact and function as predictors of performance on an online sentence completetion task in which we modify the contextual support present across sentence trials. 
     <p>
<strong style="color: #FE6100;">(3)</strong> <strong>Is the  counting pattern observed in tonal morpho-phonology (but not in segmental morpho-phonology) due to a synchronic learnability gap or a diachronic accidental gap?</strong> Working with Jian Cui (doctoral student) and and Dr. Jesse Snedeker we are exploring this typological asymmetry and how feature (tone vs. segment) and counting (counting vs. non-counting) interact to influence performance on a task that involves learning a morphological (i.e., pluralization) rule in an artificial language. 
    <p>     
    Through an online computer-based task on the PcIbex platform (Zehr & Schwarz, 2018), participants are 
 trained to learn a pluralization rule that involves some combination of feature assignment and counting (e.g., tonal assignment and counting or segmental assignment and non-counting) in an artificial language. We  then assess performance on selecting the correct pluralization of novel words in the artificial language and see if it differs signficantly based on some combination of feature and counting. This work is being down with Cantonese-English bilignuals (more familar with tonal language systems) as well as monolingual English speakers (little to no familiarity with tonal language systems).
